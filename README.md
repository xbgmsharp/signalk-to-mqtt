# Signal K - MQTT Gateway

Signal K Node server plugin that functions as a gateway between MQTT and SK server. You can
- run a local server that has all SK data available and that routes all data from other MQTT clients to Signal K deltas. The server is advertised via mdns/Bonjour
- connect to a MQTT server and send deltas you choose with chosen interval to `signalk/delta`

If you run a local server you can send data to the server like so:

`mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -m 292 -t 'vessels/self/environment/temperature/outside'`

You can check that data is being sent to the local server with `mosquitto_sub`:
```
$ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1884 -t 'vessels/self/navigation/speedOverGround'
